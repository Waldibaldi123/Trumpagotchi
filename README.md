# Trumpagotchi
Political satire in form of a digital pet iOS game. The goal is to 'survive' Trump as long as possible by slipping into the role of his aide and taking care of all the weird habits Trump has. Recruited and worked with artists and political science researches in the US and Austria. With a focus on scalability, the app implements an entity component system, state machines and game physics.
